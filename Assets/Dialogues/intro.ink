=== Intro ===
Today is LARAS birthday party and KAY is invited.

But since he woke up, he feels like he has no energy at all. He feels tired and also a little sad. But why?

Is it because some children in school laughed at him?

He wants to talk to his mother, IRENE. But first, he checks the mirror and tries to sort his thoughts.
